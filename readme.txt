Turn your WordPress gallery into a masonry layout or into a slider

== Description ==
Instantly apply a masonry layout to your WordPress galleries - with an optional lightbox slider. Users can also then click on images within the gallery to launch a sliding carousel. The carousel sits in a lightbox effect over the content, allowing users to scroll through each gallery image.

Or, instantly turn your galleries into sliders.

= Similar plugins =
Masonry Gallery Slider is similar in various respects to plugins like Photoswipe, Jetpack Carousel, Galleries, Envira, Soliloquy, FooGallery and probably many others. All these plugins share some of its features but none of them seemed to do exactly what I was looking for.

= Demo =
You can [see some examples here](https://gallery.catapultthemes.com/). There are examples and instructions for:

* Masonry Gallery
* Slider Gallery
* Carousel Gallery

= Usage =
Just enable the plugin. You can choose to automatically convert any existing galleries into masonry galleries or sliders. Then, pick either slider or masonry for any new galleries you create.

Galleries and sliders are responsive.

= Settings =
Apart from a few settings to enable the slider and set defaults, the slider is light on configuration. It conforms to WordPress standards and doesn't add any strange new interface elements. Just carry on making galleries as normal.

* Link To - choose whether to link images in new galleries to media files, attachment posts, or to nothing. This setting is overridden if the slider option is enabled
* Columns - choose the default number of columns in galleries
* Size - globally override the image size to use in all galleries
* Landscape/Portrait - enable this option to set different widths for portrait images and landscape images. Typically, landscape images will be twice as wide as portrait. Note that Masonry does not always fill in gaps in the layout so you may need to play around with the order of your images to get the look you want.
* Existing Gallery Format - decide how to format galleries that you created before enabling this plugin. Leave at 'Default' for galleries to retain their current formats, or set to 'Masonry' or 'Slider' to update all galleries.
* Enable Lightbox Slider - yes, you've guessed it. Select this option to generate a carousel style slider in a lightbox when a gallery image is clicked

= To Do =
It's simple at the moment but you can expect the following features to be added over time:
* More configuration options, e.g. margins, padding, etc
* Captions and titles
* Thumbnail navigation
* Transition effects
* Style options
* Different gallery layouts, e.g. Flickr style, flex images

= Credits =
Thanks to [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) for the jQuery carousel. And [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for the stock images used in the demo.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The gallery layout doesn't seem to have changed in my editor. Should it? =
No. The layout will only change on the front end. You will still see the standard gallery layout in your edit screen.
